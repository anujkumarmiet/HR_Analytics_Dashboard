# HR_Analytics_Dashboard
### The HR Analytics Dashboard for Employee Attrition provides a comprehensive overview of workforce turnover within the company. It is designed to offer insights into key factors influencing attrition, enabling HR teams to make data-driven decisions. 


# Recommendations:
### **Targeted Retention Programs for Key Roles:**

Since Laboratory Technicians and Research Scientists show higher attrition rates, targeted programs like career development, mentorship, or skill-building initiatives should be introduced to increase retention in these critical roles.

### **Sales Department Interventions:**

The Sales department shows a higher attrition rate, signaling potential issues such as high work pressure, unclear career progression, or compensation dissatisfaction. HR should consider investigating these areas through employee surveys or interviews and implementing solutions like performance-based rewards, better work-life balance policies, or clearer promotion paths.

### **Address Attrition Among Bachelor’s Degree Holders:**

The attrition rate among Bachelor’s degree holders is concerning. HR should explore whether employees with bachelor's degrees feel they have limited growth opportunities and develop tailored career development programs, such as offering more training and advancement opportunities.

### **Age-Specific Engagement Strategies:**

The high attrition rate in the 26-35 age group suggests that mid-career employees might be seeking better opportunities. Offering flexible work arrangements, leadership development, or succession planning could help retain these valuable employees.

### **Focus on Single Employees:**

Given that single employees have the highest attrition rate, HR could explore introducing initiatives to support their career growth, such as mentoring, social engagement opportunities, or even flexible working arrangements to help with work-life balance.

### **Gender Based Retention Efforts:**

While no alarming disparities in attrition by gender are visible, it's important to continue monitoring this closely to ensure equitable treatment. Programs that support both male and female employees, especially in career development and work-life balance, should be considered to maintain gender parity.

### **Improve Job Satisfaction:**

The Job Satisfaction Rating is not explicitly shown but would be crucial for reducing turnover. HR should assess current job satisfaction levels through surveys and address areas of concern like workload, benefits, and company culture to improve overall employee engagement.

**These insights and recommendations can help the company focus on the right areas to improve employee retention and reduce future attrition.**
